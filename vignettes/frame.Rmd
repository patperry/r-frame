Data with Context: the `frame` package
======================================


The package is built around the idea that a data point consists of a
(variable, key, value) triple identifying an attribute, target, and value.
This notion of data differs from Wickham's notion of "tidy" data, which allows
only (variable, value) pairs.  Having explicit support for keys makes it
easier to link different measurements made on the same set of individuals and
makes it easier to identify the sources giving rise to downstream results.  R
`data.frame` objects have partial support for keys through their `rownames`;
the `dataset` object extends this support by allowing non-character and
multi-component keys.
